GDS generation:

pattern2 file generates pattern and image of speckles.

Input variables: 
region_x and region_y define size
speckle width (obvious)
subset_dimensions determines density of speckles - uses 3x3 speckles per subset
then run gds_generator to make gds file (should do automatically if in correct directory)

3400 200nm speckles takes 1h 10m or so to pattern on MacBook Air
