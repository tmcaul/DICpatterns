- delete_list: has a bug: NULL is not returned correctly

- 'flatten' method for libraries to replace all sref and aref elements
  with the contents of the referenced structures (removes hierarchy).

- calculate bounding boxes of elements, structures and libraries
  (bbox methods)

- mitering of paths with acute angles in 'poly_path.m'

- more scripts: gdsextract: extract structures from gds libraries
                gdswindow:  extract data in a window
                gdsfilter:  extract data by layer
		gdsrename:  rename structures in a gds 
		gdsflatten: flatten the hierarchy in a gds file
		
- fix gdsmerge so that it can handle duplicate structure names.

- filter function to copy e.g. individual layers or elements of a
  specified type


----------------------------------------------------------

- how to handle external libraries ? (NOT NEEDED)

- new Clipper library 5.0.x (DONE)

- Fix: PLEX heads are not identified when reading a plex; must be 
  made negative when bit 24 is set. (DONE)

- low level mex functions gds_read_element and gds_write_element to
  speed reading and writing of library files. The new I/O functions are
  about a factor of 5 faster than the previous ones. Should be good for 
  libraries with 100 million elements or so. (DONE) 
  
- make the xy property of boundary and path elements always a cell array
  internally, because it simplifies the methods of the gds_element
  class. (DONE)

- srename method for the gds_library class to rename a structure and
  all sref and aref elements that reference the structure. (DONE)

- support the FORMAT and MASK related record types (NO, too archaic and
  makes no sense for this toolbox.)

- there is still a bug: elements can have more than one property
  record. (DONE) 

- use a sparse matrix for the adjacency matrix. (DONE)
  The adjacency matrix of structure graphs with thousands of 
  structures no longer consumes too much memory.

- rename layerstat --> layerinfo (DONE)

- use 'ismember' in adjmatrix.m (DONE)

- in adjmatrix.m, @(x)sname(x) --> @sname (DONE) 

- poly_convert method for libraries (DONE)

- improve poly_convert for structures - always convert all elements to 
  boundaries (PARTLY DONE - text and node elements are ignored)
  
- methods to calculate and change boundary orientation (DONE)

- better tutorial especially on working with structures/libraries
  (partly DONE)

- speed up library reading. (DONE - as much as possible in pure Octave/MATLAB)

- tree view of structures in a library (DONE)

- don't discard record dates  (DONE)

- subtree method to copy a structure and all dependent children
  from a library (DONE)

- new methods: (DONE)
  * add_struct for structures (adds an sref
  * add_element for structures
  * add_struct for libraries
  these make a hierarchical design syntactically more obvious
  
- update polygon font to a complete font based on the DEPLOF font (DONE)

- methods for elements
  * poly_box
  * poly_text
  * poly_path
  convert the respective elements into boundary elements (DONE)

- support for path type 4, if I can figure out what it is. (DONE)

- make 'gds_structure' more flexible by allowing to pass structures
  and cell arrays of structures. This will result in creation of 'sref'
  elements for each structure that is passed as an argument. (DOESN'T work,
  because it is not possible to add parameters of the sref's.)

- make 'write_gds_library' check if all structures are referenced and
  print a warning if not. NOT NECESSARY; it can be checked
  immediately by inspecting the layout - only slows down writing
  of files, especially when there are many structures.
  
- integrate polygon clipper into the gdsii library. (DONE)

- a method for creating compound elements from simple boundary,
  path, and sref elements.  (Use '+' operator ??) (DONE)

- better directory structure (DONE)

- rewrite all higher level functions to use object oriented 
  functions.(DONE)

- method for gds_library to summarize structure and element statistics
  (DONE)
